# Spotlight Scraper

This is a small script that downloads images in resolution 1920x1080 from [Windows Spotlight Images](https://windows10spotlight.com).

## Prerequisites

This script runs on Python `3.6` or higher.

I recommend using a virtual environment.

## Usage

1. Install required packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:

```shell
python scraper.py
```

3. Find the downloaded images in the `out/` folder.
